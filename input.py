#we try to learn print value based on input
#first for accepting input we should use function input() as default from python
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# #code above means we create variable name and the value is from function input
# #lets start to print
# print(name)
#
# #lets concate the input with outher string
# sentence = "Welcome "+name
# print(sentence)


#lets start to ask person name and their favorite foods
name = input("Enter your name: ")
favorite_food = input("Enter your favorite food: ")
print('favorite food of '+ name + ' is ' + favorite_food)
